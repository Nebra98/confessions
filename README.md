The Confessions web application allows users to post their confessions anonymously, discuss with other users in anonymous comments, and save confessions for later viewing. In order for users to be able to save their confessions, they must create a user account.

The web application uses PHP, specifically the Laravel web framework, for its backend. Use MySql for data storage and Bootstrap for web application layout. Also, use Ajax and JavaScript so that users can browse and interact with the application without refreshing the page.

In short, the app provides an anonymous platform for users to share their confessions, discuss with other users and save their confessions for later viewing.
